Gen AI is a project focused on generating CIFAR-10-like images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The custom GAN model consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, trained to produce realistic images and differentiate between real and generated ones.
Core Capabilities

Develops and trains a specialized Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture using the comprehensive CIFAR-10 dataset
Produces high-quality synthetic images that maintain visual fidelity to CIFAR-10 characteristics while introducing creative variations
Provides flexible implementation through both Jupyter Notebook environments and Google Colab cloud platforms

Applications & Implementation

Dataset Enhancement: Expand training datasets with algorithmically-generated synthetic samples to improve model robustness and performance
Creative Intelligence: Enable exploration of novel visual concepts and facilitate AI-driven artistic content generation
Rapid Prototyping: Generate placeholder imagery for interface mockups, design validation, and rapid application development workflows
